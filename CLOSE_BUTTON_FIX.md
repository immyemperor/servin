# Quick Fix for Close Button Issue

## Problem:
The close confirmation dialog's "Yes/No" buttons are not responding properly.

## Immediate Workaround:
1. Use **Alt+F4** to force close the window
2. Use **Task Manager** (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) to end the process if needed
3. Click the "Quit Application" button in the GUI if available

## Likely Causes:
1. Dialog callback function not properly handled
2. Event loop blocking
3. Threading issues with Fyne dialog system

## Testing Steps:
1. Try running: `.\servin-gui-fixed.exe`
2. Click the X button
3. When dialog appears, try clicking "Yes" or "No"
4. If buttons don't work, press Escape or Alt+F4

## Current Status:
- Window controls (minimize, maximize) should work
- Close button shows dialog but buttons may not respond
- Alternative quit methods available
