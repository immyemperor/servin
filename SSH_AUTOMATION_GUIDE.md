# SSH Setup Automation Scripts - Summary

## 🎯 Available Automation Scripts

We have created multiple automation scripts to help set up SSH in the Alpine Linux VM. Choose the approach that works best for you:

### 1. **Basic Instructions Script** 📋
```bash
./setup-vm-ssh.sh
```
- Provides simple manual setup instructions
- Shows VM status and SSH commands to run
- Best for: Quick reference

### 2. **Advanced Automation Script** 🤖
```bash
./automate-vm-ssh.exp
```
- Uses expect to test SSH connectivity
- Provides detailed setup commands
- Includes troubleshooting steps
- Best for: Comprehensive automation attempt

### 3. **Comprehensive Setup Script** 🛠️
```bash
./setup-ssh-automated.sh
```
- Tests VM status and SSH connectivity
- Creates setup scripts and detailed instructions
- Includes alternative approaches and troubleshooting
- Best for: Complete setup guidance

### 4. **Container Testing Script** 🧪
```bash
./test-vm-containers.sh
```
- Tests VM and SSH status
- Demonstrates container functionality if SSH works
- Shows what's possible once SSH is configured
- Best for: Verifying the complete setup

### 5. **Complete VM Setup Script** 🚀
```bash
./setup-vm-complete.sh
```
- Restarts VM with enhanced configuration
- Attempts automated SSH setup
- Tests and verifies container functionality
- Best for: Full automated setup attempt

## 🎮 Recommended Usage

### Quick Start (Recommended):
```bash
# Run the comprehensive setup
./setup-ssh-automated.sh

# Follow the manual instructions shown
# Then test with:
./test-vm-containers.sh
```

### Alternative - Complete Automation:
```bash
# Try full automation (may require manual intervention)
./setup-vm-complete.sh
```

## 🔧 Manual Setup Commands (Copy-Paste Ready)

If you prefer manual setup, connect to the VM console and run:

```bash
apk update
apk add openssh sudo
echo 'PermitRootLogin yes' >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config
echo 'PasswordAuthentication yes' >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config
echo 'root:servin123' | chpasswd
rc-update add sshd default
rc-service sshd start
```

## ✅ Verification

After setup, verify with:
```bash
ssh root@localhost -p 2222
# Password: servin123
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

Once SSH is working:
1. Test containers: `./servin run hello-world`
2. Run web services: `./servin run nginx:alpine`
3. Execute commands: `./servin exec <container> sh`
4. View logs: `./servin logs <container>`

## 📊 Current Status

- ✅ QEMU VM running successfully
- ✅ Alpine Linux booted and accessible
- ✅ Network configuration with SSH port forwarding
- ✅ VM status detection working
- 🔄 SSH configuration (manual step required)
- 🎯 Ready for native Linux container testing

The VM infrastructure is complete and ready for container operations once SSH is configured!
